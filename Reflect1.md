The first four chapters of the data science wiki entries discuss the beginnings and concept of data science, the disciplines and methods that comprise the field, and the contributions data science has made to world. Thinking broadly on the topics covered in the first few chapters, bioinformatics and data science cam be considered one in the same. 
	The chapter one discusses how the field of data science really emerged around 2001 and exploded in 2010 because of the need to analyze big data. My principle definition of bioinformatics is storing and analyzing large quantities of biological data. Essentially, one can consider bioinformatics to be a subcategory of data science. This is especially true when one considers the rate at which genomes are being sequenced and annotated in today’s age.
	In the second chapter, there is an overview of the eight disciplines that comprise data science.  These eight disciplines are eerily similar to the founding principles of bioinformatics, which is computer science, biology, and statistics. The third chapter seemed to be statistic-centric as it discussed the definition of data.  Referring to variables, data points, and the popular statistic language, R, this chapter linked two of the key founding principles of data science: statistics and computer science. The collaboration of these two principles is also vital for bioinformaticians, as one has to know how to program and interpret statistics to proficiently analyze the data we work with.
	Chapter four goes into detail about the contributions of data science to world that range from baseball and health to robotics. I’m not certain of bioinformatics’ direct contributions to sport, but I know that we are revolutionizing how illnesses will be dealt with in the future through genome analyses. We are also using robots to further our understanding of the genome by discovering never before contrived gene functions. 
	These first four chapters were very interesting, and it was good to get a better understanding of parent term that bioinformatics lives under. I am excited to read the next few chapters.
